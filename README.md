<h1>Vulnerability Assessment</h1> 

This project outlines the importance of a vulnerability assessment by identifying potential risks and how to secure it.<br /> 

  

<h2>Technologies Used</h2> 

  
- Windows Server

- Nessus Essentials

- Windows ISO File
   

<h2>Step 1:Install VMware player and Windows 10 ISO </h2>

Navigate to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 to download “Create Windows 10 installation media." Open the exe file and select “Create installation media” to create an ISO file to use on the VMWare player. After setting up, you can choose where to place the ISO file on your computer and let the ISO file download. 

<h2>Step 2:Download Nessus Essentials </h2>

<p> 

Download Nessus Essentials by navigating to https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials -- You will have to sign up for an account. After signing up for an account, you will receive an email with an activation code. In your email, click on the button for “Download Nessus” > Select Tenable Nessus > Select Nessus 10.6.0 and the Windows x86_64 as described above > Download > Install Nessus. Please note: Save the URL of Nessus in a Notepad > Connect via SSL and wait for installation. After connecting, skip the registration step and add the activation code from your email. It will take a while for Nessus to fully install.

<p> 

After the ISO file has been fully installed, open VMware > Create Virtual Machine > Select Install Disc Image File and find the Windows ISO file that was downloaded.  Under Specify Disk Capacity, you can add 50 GB > Select Next > Select Customize Hardware > Add 4069 Gb for the memory > Add 4 for the number of processors > Change the Network Adapter to Bridged. Changing the network adapter to 'bridge' will have the virtual machine and host computer on the same network. This will allow the Nessus implementation to communicate with the virtual machine. After changing these settings, select Close and Finish to load the virtual machine. 

Please note: You will have to finish setting up the virtual machine by creating a user profile and password and it may take several minutes. 

</p> 

<h2>Step 4: Using the Virtual Machine </h2>

<p> 
Listed are the steps when setting up Windows 10 for the VM: Select “I don’t have a product key” > Windows 10 Pro > Select Custom Install  > Select Next > Allow Windows to install (it takes a few minutes) > Set your region and language > Select Setup for Personal  Use > Select Online Account > Limited Experience > Add name for user profile and password > Setup security questions > Select Not Now > Select No for all privacy settings > Skip customization > Not Now > Allow the VM to continue to setup. Once you have successfully setup the VM, open the command line and enter “ipconfig’ to collect the IP address for the virtual machine. Next, open the command line on your actual PC and ping the VM’s IP (X.X.X.X -t) to ensure that the networks communicate to each other. In the VM, open “wf.msc” to open the virtual machines firewall > Select Defender Firewall to Turn off the firewall for Domain, Private, and Public profiles. Once the firewalls are turned off, you will see that the IP address is successfully pinging  > in your actual PC’s command line. 
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Create a New Scan in Nessus</h2>
<p>
Open Nessus Essentials > Select New Scan > Basic Network Scan > Add a Title for the scan > Paste in the IP address of the Virtual Machine > Save > Select the play button to launch to view the scan. Also, this will display vulnerability logs
